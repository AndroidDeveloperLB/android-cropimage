# Android CropImage

This library is a fork of another library with the same name (here: https://github.com/lvillani/android-cropimage ). It is used in order to allow cropping images (even really large ones).

As opposed to the other library, it supports Android API 8 and above. That's the main difference. The rest is for cleaning some code.
